Changelog : 
-------------------------------

1.5.4
    Performance Enhancement.
    The original Necrosis was not gating OnUpdate correctly.  Basically the entire
    contents of the Necrosis_OnUpdate method was being called constantly.  I placed
    a timer function in so updates happen no more than once a second.  The side effect
    of this seems to be that DoT timers for mobs no longer targeted remain even after
    the target it dead.  
    
    I will work on this.
    
    In the mean time you should not see your memory increase for no reason and you 
    will notice no more an increase in memory when in combat that for any other mods
    such as damage meters and recap.
    
1.5.3
    1. Size reduced by removing UI files named "Shard0.tga" to "Shard32.tga".  The
    "Necrosis" Sphere will always look full as a result.  However the counts for
    shards and timers remain accurate.
    
    2. New option on the first Config Menu page that turns off Healthstone trading in
    combat.  It is common during AoE in PvE raids for a warlock to have a friendly 
    player selected while in combat.  In these cases, clicking the healthstone button
    opens trade.  The option prevents this and instead properly allows the Warlock to
    consume the healthstone.
    
    3. New options on second menu page "Alert me when target has shadow vulnerability".
    This places a "Shadow Bolt" type icon (a square one) on the screen when Improved
    Shadow Bolt talent procs and the targeted mob has the "Shadow Vulnerability" Debuff.
    This icon can be moved in the same way the Shadow Trance and Anti-fear icons are moved.
    
    NOTE: while this icon is present CoA, Siphon Life, Corruption, Shadowburn and Deathcoil
    cooldowns bars will appear purple.  Unlike the green cooldown bars, purple ones do not
    fade to red as time expires.  This lets the warlock know which dots were applied while
    shadow vulnerability was up and which while it was down.
    
    NOTE2: The priest ability sets off this alert.
    
    4. "Set Event Range" slider added.  This will set the event distance for logging and 
    combat (all of them) from 5 to 200 feet.  The slider is compatable with BigWigs range
    sliders.  Use this with caution.
    
    5. Curse casting menu changed to curse selecting menu.  To use it:
        0. bind a key to "Cast Selected Curse" using the "Keybinds" menu in the wow interface.
        1. click the curse menu
        2. click one of the curses (not Amplify Curse)
            a. middle click to add pet attack.
            b. right click to cause Amp Curse to Select a curse and it will
        - The curse menu icon will change to the curse you selected
        3. The "Cast Selected Curse" keybind.
        
        NOTE: this has not been tested with a warlock who has Amp Curse.
        
    6. New keybinds:
        "Cast Selected Curse" casts the selected curse (or CoA by default)
        Banish
        Enslave
        Howl of Terror
        Fear
        Drain Soul
        Scaled Tap Life (or just Tap Life) if ScaledTapLife is not loaded.
        
    TODO: Targeted timers with estimated damage remaining instead of just seconds.

1.5.2 TOC updated to match 1.11
      Demonic Sacrifice added.
      Keybind for shadow-ward now available.

      Some FR and DE localisation error were corrected.

      Brand new Curse Menu! Curse Buttons behaviour is:
	- Amplify-able curses may be cast amplified with a right click.
	- If the target is friendly, an assist is done before casting.
	- Without target, the curse buttons don't respond.
	- Middle click cast the curse and make your pet attack if you have one.

     Soulshard sorting is now not activated by default, since some people got issues when
	switching from different version.

     Sounds should be working fine since 1.11.1, since it was a bug coming from Blizzard.
